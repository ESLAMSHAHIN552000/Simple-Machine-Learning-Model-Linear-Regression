#Simple machine learning model using linear regression 
to predict weather useing dataset with .csv extintion the data set file include years and Mean temp for some years How it works ?
1- Read .csv file ...(you can also use .xls file just un comment the 29th line and comment 28th file )
2- We use 90% of dataset to train our model and import LinearRegression class
3- print our predicted data vs real data
4- Ploting predicted data vs real data then show the slope 
5- ploting our test data 
6- request a specific year to predict weather by user
